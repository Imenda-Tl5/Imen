              I’m Imenda, a creative and intellectually curious individual with
              a strong love for science and math. I’m passionate about exploring
              and understanding how the world works, often applying knowledge to
              practical fields where I can solve problems and make an impact. I
              find joy in art, particularly drawing, which allows me to express

              creativity and expanding my perspective, even though I wouldn’t
              call myself a storyteller. Chess is another passion of mine,
              offering the perfect blend of strategy and challenge to sharpen my
              mind. I’m always eager to learn, whether it’s through reading,
              experimenting, or engaging in intellectual pursuits. My interests
              reflect a balance between logical thinking and creative
              expression, and I’m constantly driven by curiosity, a desire to
              grow, and a fascination with the possibilities of science and
              discovery.
